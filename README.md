### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chiara (she/her) and I'm currently a student at UNC Chapel Hill pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with minors in Data Science and Italian. 

I'm enjoy learning new programming languages and creating unique and complex projects that challenge my understanding and skills. I have had the opportunity to grow my experience in Software Development through an intership at Ally in Summer 2023. Here I got exposure to skills I had yet to encounter in my classes, including AWS, Agile management, and GitLab CI/CD pipelines.

During the semester, I work as a TA where I tutor students in fundamental programming concepts and assist with Python assignments. I also work with a team of organizers to put on Pearl Hacks - an annual beginner-friendly hackathon at UNC Chapel Hill for women and gender non-conforming students.
