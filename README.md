### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chiara (she/her) and I'm currently a student at UNC Chapel Hill intending to study Computer Science. 

I'm looking to learn new languages and create unique and complex projects. I work as a TA where I tutor students in fundamental programming concepts and assist with Python assignments. 

I also help organize an annual beginner-friendly hackathon at UNC Chapel Hill for women and gender non-conforming students.
