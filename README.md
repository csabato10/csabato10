### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chiara (she/her) and I'm currently a student at UNC Chapel Hill pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with minors in Data Science and Italian. 

I enjoy learning new programming languages and creating unique and complex projects that challenge my understanding and skills. My aspirations going into a career in technology is to work on applications that are going to improve and enhance day-to-day life.
